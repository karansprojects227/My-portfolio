        <p class="opacity-0">I have a well-defined roadmap to becoming a CEO in the tech industry, and my journey is structured with a clear focus on software engineering, leadership, and innovation.

Software Engineering Phase

My journey begins as a full-stack software engineer, where I am mastering 3D, animated, and high-resolution websites. I believe in learning through project-based implementation rather than just theory, ensuring that I develop real-world problem-solving skills. My initial focus is on building unique and efficient websites, experimenting with 4K resolution and AI-driven web experiences to push the boundaries of modern web development.

To strengthen my technical foundation, I am also practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using a structured approach:

1. Data Structures (concepts + implementation)


2. Algorithms (concepts + implementation)


3. Problem-solving from basic to advanced levels



Once I gain strong expertise in full-stack development, I will transition into cross-platform app development. My plan is to start learning mobile app development gradually after 2-3 years of full-stack experience, working on real-world projects that integrate AI and other cutting-edge technologies.

Education & Work Experience

Alongside my technical growth, I am pursuing a BCA in Computer Applications & IT from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham to solidify my academic foundation. I aim to maintain 100/100 marks in every semester, ensuring that I am among the top 1% of scorers.

During my BCA, I also plan to gain 6-12 months of software engineering experience, allowing me to apply my learning in a real-world setting while preparing for high-paying job opportunities in top tech companies. After BCA, I will pursue an MBA in Information Technology, which will prepare me for leadership and management roles in the tech industry.

Career Growth & Leadership

My career path is designed to take me from a software engineer to a leader and eventually a CEO. My ideal plan includes:

1. 5-6 years as a software engineer (focusing on innovation in web and app development).


2. 3-4 years in leadership roles, where I will develop management, business, and decision-making skills.


3. 4-5 years as a CTO/COO, focusing on large-scale real-world tech solutions and strategic innovation.


4. Transitioning to a CEO role, where I will drive major technological advancements.



I aim to join Meta in Mumbai or Bangalore as a Senior Software Engineer, later moving into leadership roles within Meta, Google, or Apple. If necessary, I am open to joining a startup as a CEO to accelerate my growth.

Ultimate Vision

At my peak, I want to redefine technology by working on AI-driven smart cities, brain-computer interfaces, and large-scale tech innovations. I believe in game-changing creativity, where my innovations will be so advanced that even a team of 10 people cannot compete with my level of thinking.

My journey is not just about becoming a CEO but about creating groundbreaking solutions that will shape the future of technology.
